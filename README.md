# Linear Full Tableau Implementation

> "I got sick of doing this by hand so I coded it" - Me

Ok, so, I understand that this is not the most efficient way to solve Standard Form Linear Programming problems, but in my class **ISYE 525: Linear Optimization** class at UW-Madison, I grew increasingly annoyed every time I needed to solve a Standard Form Linear Programming problem using the full tableau method by hand, so I started coding it. There are plenty of missing features that I am planning to finish up listed below. If you find any use to this code you are welcome to use it when and wherever.


## Todo

 - [ ] Different pivoting rules
 - [ ] User input
 - [ ] Dual and Primal solvers (for initial basic solutions)
 - [ ] Detecting degenerate solutions
 - [ ] Detecting solutions with infinite cost
